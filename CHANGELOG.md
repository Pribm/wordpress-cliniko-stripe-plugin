## [1.2.8] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- **Exit & Draft Save System** for patient forms:
  - Automatically saves appointment progress (all answers + step index) into `localStorage`.
  - Patient-friendly **exit modal** when leaving mid-form:
    - Options: *Stay on this page*, *Leave without saving*, *Save & Leave*.
  - **Restore bar** displayed at the top of the form if a saved draft exists, with *Continue* or *Start Over* actions.
- **Unique draft keys per form/page**:
  - Each booking page (e.g. `/book/erectile-disfunction`, `/prescriptions`) maintains its own independent draft state.
- **Stripe integration awareness**:
  - Draft save/leave modal is skipped when patient completes final payment.
  - Draft is automatically cleared after successful payment and booking confirmation.

### Changed
- **Toasts**:
  - Unified with the existing `showToast()` helper.
  - Language adapted to be more patient-friendly (avoids technical terms like *draft*):
    - On restore: *‚ÄúYour appointment form has been restored. You can continue where you left off.‚Äù*
    - On auto-save: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, your appointment details will be saved automatically if you leave.‚Äù*
    - On submit: *‚ÄúWe‚Äôve saved your appointment details while confirming your booking.‚Äù*
- **Navigation guard**:
  - In-form links now trigger the save/leave modal before navigation.
  - Browser refresh/close now triggers silent auto-save (no intrusive prompts).

### Internal
- Introduced versioned storage key schema: `clinikoFormProgress:v9:{pathname}`.
- Exposed `window.currentStep` globally for use across scripts.
- Preserves and restores **signature pad** input during draft restore.
- Hardened event binding to prevent duplicate observers in Stripe and exit-save logic.

### Added
- **NotificationService**:
  - Centralized handling of success/failure emails
  - Prevents duplicates via transient lock
  - Supports Elementor-driven templates with placeholder substitution
- **Elementor widget controls**:
  - `send_email_on_success` / `send_email_on_failure` toggles
  - `success_email_template` / `failure_email_template` raw HTML inputs
  - Templates synced to WordPress options via new `ElementorTemplateSync`
- **Success toast style** on frontend:
  - Green checkmark icon, light green background
  - Distinguishable from error toast (red)

### Changed
- **ClinikoSchedulingWorker**:
  - Now delegates notifications to `NotificationService`
  - Success flow triggers confirmation email if enabled
  - Failure flow triggers refund + failure email if enabled
  - Removed inline `wp_mail` duplication in worker

### Internal

- Elementor template sync ensures admin edits persist to runtime options
- Unified toast helper supports both success and error styling


## [1.2.3] - 2025-08-21

### Changed
- **ClinikoController**:
  - Now returns consistent error responses (`errors[]` array) for validation, API, and server exceptions
  - Validation errors return `422`, API/server issues return `500`
- **Stripe initialization**:
  - Refactored to singleton (`getStripe()`) to avoid multiple initializations
  - Payment button handler is attached only once (`paymentHandlerAttached` guard)
- **Multi-step form validation (`isCurrentStepValid`)**:
  - Added checks for Medicare fields (digit count & range)

  - Inline error messages styled in red
  - Borders reset automatically when user corrects the field

### Internal

- Improved maintainability by centralizing validation logic both server- and client-side


## [1.2.2] - 2025-08-20

### Changed

  - `create()` now always returns a `PatientForm` or throws an `ApiException` (never `null`)
  - `delete()` now returns `void` and throws on failure instead of returning `true`
  - Improved error handling in `create()` and `update()` (guards against empty API responses)
  - Stricter type hints and docblocks added across methods
  - Cleaned up unused imports and redundant null checks

### Internal
- Aligns with the ongoing refactor of models and code abstraction
